# **Banking System – React Frontend**

## **Overview**

This project is a simple Banking System Frontend built using ReactJS. It was created as part of the daily classwork and homework done in class. The project includes essential banking pages such as Login, Dashboard, Account Details, Deposit, Withdraw, and Transaction History. Since this is a frontend-only project, all data is handled using React state without any backend or database connection.

## **Features & Functionality**

The application allows users to navigate across pages using React Router. Each page is designed with basic CSS or Tailwind to keep the UI clean and easy to use. Reusable components such as buttons, cards, and the navbar were added to make the structure more organized. All classwork tasks, including building the pages, and all homework tasks like adding validations, styling, and cleaning the component structure, have been completed.

## **Learning & Development Experience**

Throughout the development process, daily classwork covered topics like creating components, managing state, and building simple forms. Homework reinforced these concepts by adding validations, improving layouts, and enhancing styling. By the end of the project, the codebase became more organized, and the UI was polished.

## **How to Run the Project**

To run the project, first install the required dependencies using `npm install`, and then start the development server using `npm run dev`. Once the server is running, you can open the project in your browser using the URL shown in the terminal.

## **Conclusion**

This project helped practice essential React concepts such as state, props, routing, form handling, and component structure. It serves as a simple but complete example of building a user interface for a banking system using React.
